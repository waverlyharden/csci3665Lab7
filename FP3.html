    <b>Summary</b>
    The Kate Furbish Dataset consists of 5509 examples and 51 attributes. 
    Each example is an individual specie of plant that was discovered by Kate
    Furbish. The attributes for each example range from being numeric or 
    categorical. The numeric values of each example highlight values for things
    like the date and time of the discovery. These are indicated as integer
    values. The categorical data for this dataset categorizes the examples by
    their scientific name, their location or who discovered the specific 
    eample.<br><br>

    The specific attributes that we will be using for this assignment are the 
    attributes that correspond with the scientific names of the dataset, the 
    ones that categorize by location, and the attributes that describe the date.

    Because there is so much extra data that is not necessary for our 
    experiments, we left them out of the sample.
