    Please see <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~wharden/Final_Project/FP10.html">FP10 </a> as the goals for our project. Nothing but implementing 
    regualar bar graphs with our data has been prototyped. That can be found 
    <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~wharden/Final_Project/FP6/bar.html">here</a>.<br><br>

    <b>Meeting with Collaborator:</b>We met with our collaborator this Wednesday
    (11/15) to go over the general goal of our project. We decided the main 
    questions we would like to focus on is Kate Furbish's travel throughout 
    Maine (visualized as a choropleth) as she was collecting plant specimens 
    as well as considering the amount of collections by grouping genera with 
    their respective species (visualized as a stacked bar graph). A few
    alterations we would have to do with our data is create a column of just 
    the genus names as well as ensure the regional names for Main are somewhat 
    the same name as ones we found in our json file for the <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~ndkent/csci3665/P3Kent-Harden/choropleth.html">Maine Choropleth</a>. 
    Additionally, we were hoping to use the Harvard data in addition to the 
    Bowdoin data for more specifics like the genus names as well as including
    months, rather than just years, for a better understanding of when Kate 
    Furbish collected her specimens. This would also need to be standardized 
    in our dataset as some are written with hyphens while others with forward 
    slashes. Also, in the harvard data, if we could figure out correct links. 
    It might be nice in addition to add links to her illustrations for each 
    genus.<br><br>

    I think our biggest issue for FP11 was ensuring our data is in a good
    working mode for us to begin prototyping with the choropleth and stacked
    bar chart. So, hopefully we can see if there's one of the two that we can
    begin with.<br><br>

    Our immediate goals for the past week (as described in the FP10 timeline) 
    was to create static prototypes and the basic layout of our visualization 
    pages.This would entail that our data was in the correct format we need.
    <br><br>

    Over the course of the last few days, we have been able to obtain data in 
    the format we needed and have started working more on the visualization 
    prototypes. This week we are working on combining the Harvard data with the
    Bowdoin Data for the Stacked Bar Chart. For the Choropleth, we are still 
    waiting to get a json file that has all of the appropriate town names in it.
    Some of them were mislabeled in the choropleth example we are using. Moving
    forward, hopefully we should be able to continue working on our Choropleth 
    tomorrow.<br><br>
