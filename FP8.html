    <b>Summary</b>
    The Kate Furbish Dataset consists of two csv files. The first file is of the
    Harvard dataset and has 5509 examples and 51 attributes.
    Each example is an individual specie of plant that was discovered by Kate
    Furbish. The attributes for each example range from being numeric or 
    categorical. The numeric values of each example highlight values for things
    like the date and time of the discovery. These are indicated as integer
    values. The categorical data for this dataset categorizes the examples by
    their scientific name, their location or who discovered the specific 
    example.The second file is of the bowdoin dataset. This dataset consists of
    roughly 1000 examples and up to 23 attributes. The attributes describe the
    names of the species, the year, and location. For the year and location, 
    there can be up to 8 instances where they are recorded which account for
    16 of the attributes available.<br><br>

    The specific attributes that we will be using for this assignment are the 
    attributes that correspond with the scientific names of the dataset, the 
    ones that categorize by location, and the attributes that describe the date.
    For both datasets, there is a lot of missing information that we need to 
    figure out how to work with. In some cases, the missing information will 
    it harder to use the visualizations such as the choropleth.

    Here is an example of <a href= "sample.csv"> The Sample Attributes</a>. Because
    there is so much extra data that is not necessary for our experiments, we
    left them out of the sample.
