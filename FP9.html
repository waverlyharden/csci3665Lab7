    <b>Final Project</b>
    <br><br>
    
    <b>Choropleth Prototype:</b>
    Our <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~wharden/Final_Project/FP6/choropleth.html">
      Choropleth Prototype</a> was going to be used to show where most of Kate Furbish's 
    discoveries were made. In showing the prototype to the class, many people thought that
    the choropleth would work best if we figure out how to use the corrdinates of the 
    locations that were visited because it might work better for coding the choropleth.
    Additionally, people thought that our Choropleth should show the overall accumulation
    of locations visited because then you can see where all of the discoveries were made
    instead of just a few in time.

    <b>Scatterplot Prototype:</b>
    For our <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~wharden/Final_Project/FP6/scatterplot.html">
      Scatterplot Prototype</a> we were planning on addressing a series of discoveries 
    over time. The majority of the feedback we received for this visualization was to 
    clarift what was actually going to be shown on the scatterplot. This means that for a 
    given time on the x-axis, what was shown. Is it a single circle or multiple? People
    reccomended that each point be an individual discovery in the scatterplot. Also 
    people said that for this visualization, what might be most effective is if we have
    a dropdown menu with each specie or year to show the relationship that time has on
    Furbish's discovery trends. People also recommended that we possibly include a brush
    or zoom, so that we can see changes within specific years since the range of years 
    is so large.

    <b>Histogram Prototype:</b>
    For the <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~wharden/Final_Project/FP6/histogram.html"> 
      Histogram Prototype</a> we were planning on showing how often Kate Furbish was able
    to find species based on their common name over time. The feedback that we received 
    for this project suggested that we add more functionality to the visualization. Right
    now, we have buttons for showing specific years in the dataset. Some people thought
    that the Histogram was too similar to the scatterplot and recommended showing this 
    information as a multi-line graph for each specie family or common name over time.
    This might make understanding the information easier as well and would give better
    context over time.

    <b>Bar Graph Prototype:</b>
    For the <a href= "http://www.bowdoin.edu/~wharden/Final_Project/FP6/bar.html"> Bar
      Graph Prototype</a> we were planning on showing how often Kate Furbish was able
    to find species. For this visualization, we also thought of creating a stacked bar 
    chart that could potentially show the incorrect vs. correct classifications of each 
    species.Right now, we have buttons for sorting and for showing every five years. For
    this visualization, people recommended that we include a dropdown menu of each specie
    family. This would show the bars for each specie within the family which would be
    useful in seeing which species are more commonly found within a family. This might be
    necessary because people also thought that showing all of the species on a single 
    graph would be too hard to see.
