    Our goals for completing the project mainly consist of getting the data to
    work with the visualizations that we want to do. The Kate Furbish data  
    consists of two different datasets. Our goal was to make it so that we could
    add the examples from both datasets into our choropleth and Stacked Bar to 
    see if that would work, but we have been runnning into trouble doing that.
    <br><br>
    
    In terms of the project in general, in the last week we have decided to
    scrap the stacked bar chart visualization and do a scatter plot instead.
    We switched visualizations so late because we were having too many problems 
    getting the data to properly map to the stacked bar chart. 
    We were able to complete the choropleth. It now 
    contains a dropdown menu for all of the specie families and two buttons to 
    switch between the datasets.  <br><br>

    Our final project consisted of a choropleth and a scatterplot graph.
    The Choropleth dataset is able to switch between both the Harvard and 
    Bowdoin datasets. I can al show the values for each town in the tooltip and
    additionally it has a color scale for the individual towns by frequency.
    By next week, we should definitely be at the point where
    we have our visualizations working for at the Bowdoin and Harvard datasets.
    The Stacked Bar Graph should be able to show the data for each genus 
    family
    from the Bowdoin dataset. The Choropleth should be able to either show the
    data for each individual species in the both datasets individually or for 
    all species
    that Kate Furbish looked at over time within maine. If there is time, we 
    would want to animate the graph using a slider for dates, but that has to 
    happen after we get it working for the Bowdoin and Harvard data.
