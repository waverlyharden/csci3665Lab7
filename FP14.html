    Our goals for completing the project mainly consist of getting the data to
    work with the visualizations that we want to do. The Kate Furbish data  
    consists of two different datasets. Our goal was to make it so that we could
    add the examples from both datasets into our choropleth and Stacked Bar to 
    see if that would work, but we have been runnning into trouble doing that.
    <br><br>
    
    In terms of the project in general, in the last week we have decided to
    scrap the stacked bar chart visualization and do a scatter plot instead.
    We switched visualizations so late because we were having too many problems 
    getting the data to properly map to the stacked bar chart. 
    We were able to complete the choropleth. It now 
    contains a dropdown menu for all of the specie families and two buttons to 
    switch between the datasets.  <br><br>

    Our final project consisted of a choropleth and a scatterplot graph.
    The Choropleth dataset is able to switch between both the Harvard and 
    Bowdoin datasets. I can also show the frequency values for each town in the tooltip and
    additionally it has a color scale for the individual towns by frequency.
    The choropleth can also zoom in and out and you can move it around by grabbing the map
    The Choropleth should be able to either show the
    data for each individual species in the both datasets individually or for 
    all species that Kate Furbish looked at over time within maine.
    It looks at all species initially and then changes to individual species once you use the
    dropdown menu. If there was time, we would have wanted to animate the graph using a slider for dates, but there
    was not enough time to complete that task.

    For the scatterplot, the visualization looked at the link between genus and number of examples. The number of examples 
    was on the y-axis. Each genus was represented by a 'circle' on the scatter plot. Depending on how many species were within
    a given genus, the circle would be larger or smaller. This graph also has a time-series property to it. It will start at 1870 and finish 
    at 1920 and show the rise in instances for each genus, however, as of now we were unable to get the cirles to travel backwards in time.
    They currently continue up and out of bounds if you keep scrolling over the dates. If there was more time, we would've made the 
    visualization so that you can only look at an individual genus or location. This would give more insight to the places Kate Furbish
    traveled.
