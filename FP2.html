    <b>Choropleth</b>
    A choropleth is a map in which different regions are shaded to highlight a
    particular attribute. Because there is so much data pertaining to location
    in the Furbish dataset, it might be beneficial to have a choropleth that 
    shows where most of the discoveries were made. The colors could indicate how
    many discoveries were made in specific places. This could also be tailored
    to only show a single species of plant and where it was discovered across 
    the U.S.<br><br>

    <b>Bar Chart</b>
    Because there were so many samples that were collected in various regions,
    a bar chart that shows the frequencies that each species of plant was found
    would be really useful in visualizing how often species were found.<br><br>

    <b>Heatmap</b>
    The Furbish dataset has a lot of information for each individual species 
    such as leaf size and color. It might be useful to use a heatmap in order 
    to show the correlation between an attribute like leaf size to each 
    individual species. This visualization could also be used for many of the
    attributes besides just leaf size or color, so there could be a potential 
    dropdown menu to change the attribute used.<br><br>

    <b>Histogram</b>
    We could also use a histogram to bin the species based on the quality of 
    their attributes. This would show us a range of the values. As you changed 
    the range, there would be more and more bins. This would also be effective
    if it showed the names of the species included in each bin with a mouseover
    or tooltip. Like the Heatmap, the attributes can be easily changed so a 
    dropdown menu might be useful here. <br><br>

    <b>Scatterplot</b>
    For the scatterplot, it might be useful to use a time series graph to show
    how many species were discovered at a certain time. Each specie could be
    represented as a circle and when you mouseover, you could see the specie
    name and location. The time series could also use a zoom or drag so you
    only look at part of the timeline.<br><br>
