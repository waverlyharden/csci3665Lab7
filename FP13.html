    Our goals for completing the project mainly consist of getting the data to
    work with the visualizations that we want to do. The Kate Furbish data  
    consists of two different datasets. Our goal was to make it so that we could
    add the examples from both datasets into our choropleth and histogram to 
    see if that would work, but we have been runnning into trouble doing that.
    <br><br>
    
    In terms of the project in general, in the last week we have improved our 
    homepage- adding tabs at the top of each page that link to each of our 
    visualizations. The homepage now also includes a picture of Kate Furbish 
    as well as a summary of who she is and what we plan on doing with her data.
    We have all been able to work on the Choropleth. It now 
    contains a dropdown menu for all of the specie families and two buttons to 
    switch between the datasets. We are still working to get the color scaling 
    to work for the map. For our Stacked Bar Graph, we have been able to read 
    in some of
    the data, but it is not being used in properly for the Stacked Bar Graph
    and we're getting errors. <br><br>

    For the previous week, the biggest goal that we had depended on the data 
    that was necessary for the visualizations. Since last week, we have received
    an updated maine.json file with more town names and Harvard data in the same
    format as the Bowdoin data. This will make the Harvard dataset easier to 
    work with also since many of the unnecessary attributes have been removed.
    <br><br>

    Our immediate goals for next week are to just mess with our Choropleth and 
    Stacked Bar Graph examples so that we can get things read in and used
    properly for
    both datasets. By next week, we should definitely be at the point where
    we have our visualizations working for at the Bowdoin and Harvard datasets.
    The Stacked Bar Graph should be able to show the data for each genus 
    family
    from the Bowdoin dataset. The Choropleth should be able to either show the
    data for each individual species in the both datasets individually or for 
    all species
    that Kate Furbish looked at over time within maine. If there is time, we 
    would want to animate the graph using a slider for dates, but that has to 
    happen after we get it working for the Bowdoin and Harvard data.
